    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve all of the authenticated domains that
    have been assigned to a specific subuser.**  Authenticated domains can be
    associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This
    functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's domain
    authentication. To associate a authenticated domain with a subuser, the
    parent account must first authenticate and validate the domain. The the
    parent may then associate the authenticated domain via the subuser
    management tools.
